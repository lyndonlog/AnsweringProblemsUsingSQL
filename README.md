# AnsweringProblemsUsingSQL
I used W3school dataset for answering sample real world problems. I became familiar about the use of simple queries, Join queries and subqueries then make complicated codes to answer sample questions. The dataset sql file is the dataset and the SolvingQueries sql file is my code on solving problems.

Import first dataset sql file into Mysql then copy paste SolvingQueries sql file to new created script sql file then run it.
